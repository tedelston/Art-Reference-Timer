Art Reference Timer Privacy Policy
Last updated: [08/02/2026]

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how Art Reference Timer (“the App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) accesses, uses, and protects information when you use the application to connect to your Google account and view your Google Photos reference albums.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.

2. Information we access
When you sign in with Google and grant the requested permissions, the App may access the following information:

Google account basic information

Your Google account identifier and email address for authentication and to associate the session with your account.

Google Photos Library data (read‑only)

A list of albums in your Google Photos Library.

Metadata for albums that match your chosen filter (for example, albums whose titles include the word “Reference”), such as album ID, title, cover photo, and media item count.

Metadata for media items (photos) in those albums, such as media ID, file name, and URLs for displaying images.

The App does not request or use write access to your Google Photos Library.

3. How we use your information
We use the information described above solely to provide the core functionality of the App:

Authenticate you with your Google account.

Retrieve and display only the Google Photos albums you choose (for example, “Reference Images – Woman with Blade”).

Display images from those albums in timed drawing sessions with configurable durations and options.

We do not use your Photos data for advertising, profiling, or unrelated analytics.

If we ever decide to use your data for a purpose not covered in this Policy, we will update this Policy and, where required, request your consent again before doing so.

4. Data storage and retention
Depending on how you deploy the App, the following may apply:

The App primarily processes Google Photos data in memory in your browser session for the purpose of showing albums and images during your drawing session.

We do not intentionally store, persist, or log the contents of your photos on our own servers.

If we store any cached data (such as album IDs or image URLs) for performance or session continuity, it is stored only as long as necessary to provide the App’s features (for example, until the current session ends or short‑lived cache expiry).

Access tokens or other credentials received from Google are used only to authenticate requests to the Google Photos API and are not shared with third parties.

5. Data sharing
We do not sell or rent your personal information or Google Photos data. We do not share your Google Photos content with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:

Service providers (infrastructure): If the App is hosted on a third‑party platform (such as GitHub Pages or a hosting provider), that provider may technically process data as part of delivering the service (for example, serving web assets over HTTPS).

Legal requirements: We may disclose information if required to do so by law, regulation, or valid legal process, or to protect our rights, property, or safety.

We do not permit third‑party advertising networks to access your Google Photos data through this App.

6. Your choices and controls
You have the following options:

Grant or revoke Google access: You can choose whether or not to sign in with your Google account and grant the Google Photos permission.

Disconnect the App: You can revoke the App’s access to your Google account at any time by visiting your Google account permissions page (e.g., https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) and removing the App.

Album selection: Within the App, you can choose which specific albums to display during your sessions.

If we store any data outside your Google account, you may request deletion by contacting us using the details below.

7. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including:

Using secure connections (HTTPS) where supported by the hosting platform.

Limiting access to tokens and sensitive data to the components strictly needed to provide the App’s functionality.

Avoiding unnecessary logging of personal data or photo contents.

However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

8. Children’s privacy
The App is intended for use by adults and is not directed at children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.

9. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after any changes means you accept the revised Policy.
